Started building the plant care app with Fast API, PostgresQL, Docker, and Vite React.

Set up Docker for a consistent development environment, learning new things each day.

Faced challenges integrating Vite with React, but steadily making progress.

Began working on the dashboard feature for plant-specific to-dos.

Struggled a bit with Swagger documentation, but slowly getting the hang of it.

Tackled the database structure in PostgresQL, enjoying the learning process.

Experimented with different naming conventions to find what works best.

Had fun customizing the UI using Material UI, really liked the design options.

Worked on state management in React, making sure everything runs smoothly.

Resolved a few unexpected API bugs, felt good to solve them.

Focused on improving app performance and load times, important for user experience.

Started using Material UI more, really enhancing the look and feel of the app.

Adrianna did a great job on the backend, really held things together.

Jason handled the authentication part, learned a lot just by watching him work.

Deon faced some challenges and had family matters, but he's been doing great recently.

Another day of updating the app from GitLab, staying on top of changes.

Focused on refining the user interface, making it more user-friendly.

Spent time writing clean, well-documented code for easier future maintenance.

Updated the app again from GitLab, important to keep everything current.

Looking forward to improving the app based on user feedback after launch.
